# Village Economy

Village Economy is a Fabric 1.20.1 addon designed to extend:

- Trade Overhaul
- Dynamic Villager Trades
- Numismatic Overhaul

Rather than replacing those mods, Village Economy gives every village its own local economy.

## Vision

Each village should feel alive.

Selling lots of bread in one village should lower its value there.
Mining towns should value ores differently from farming villages.
Villagers should slowly recover from market changes over time.

## Target Versions

- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader 0.19.3
- Java 17

## Current Status

The repository currently contains the buildable project foundation only. Gameplay systems, compatibility layers, configuration, and mixins have not been implemented yet.

Fabric API is a required runtime dependency. Mod Menu is supported as an optional development/runtime companion; its configuration screen will be added with the planned config system.

## Building

Install Java 17, then run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

On Windows:

```bat
gradlew.bat build
```

The remapped release jar is written to:

```text
build/libs/village-economy-0.1.0.jar
```

GitHub Actions runs the same build for pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatches, then uploads the release jar as a workflow artifact.
